Title: Stick Hockey

## of Players: 2

## Rules/Win/Lose Conditions

First player to reach 3 points wins 
Player to not obtain 3 points will lose

## What I must do
Use canvas to create gameboard and use javascript to render objects
Animate my hockey stick to move and hit the hockey puck
## Goals
Create 2 players
Add hit detection so when my hockey stick moves against the puck it moves
Add a track of scores for each player
Create goals and have them make a point for the player that scores in it



## Potential Roadblocks
The goals that will be the most difficult for me to do is probably coding the AI to move up and down by itself. Also creating the point system and making it work.

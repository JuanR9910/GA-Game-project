Title: Stick Hockey Turbo

## of Players: 1

## Rules/Win/Lose Conditions

First player to reach 3 points wins 
Player to not obtain 3 points will lose

## What I must do
Will be using canvas mostly to style my hockey stick, the puck, and the board.

## Goals

Give the option to play vs a CPU. Code an AI to play vs the player
Set up a function for the player and CPU that whenever they score a goal they recieve 1 point.
Add a function for hit detection so the hockey sticks can hit the puck in order for it to move, also add a function for the puck to bounce off the walls and enter the goals. 


## Potential Roadblocks
The goals that will be the most difficult for me to do is probably coding the AI to move up and down by itself. Also creating the point system and making it work.
